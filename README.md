How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	Direct interviews with the end users helped put the user needs/wants in perspective – having these users available throughout the development process was hugely beneficial as they could be referenced throughout. Taking the user’s wants and needs and using that to develop user personas and stories created a “source” that could be referred at any time. The user stories feed into deliverable features for the product which both help guide development as well as provide notable milestones. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
	The iterative process has always been at the core of my development process, game design philosophy heavily revolves around iterating and testing ideas. For my own development process I think that creating strong sprint “loops” is hugely valuable: often I get stuck into developing and redeveloping a small aspect of a project and/or ending up expanding on certain aspects of a project that are, in the end, relatively small portions of the final product. Keeping to a shorter, more focused sprint within development will help ensure that the right aspects get iterated on and developed along a projects lifetime. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	While of course, being respectful and kind are traits of any good team member, I feel like in an Agile group having high levels of communication is the most important. Skill and technical levels will vary with each team’s level and project scale, but throughout any project high levels of communication will help facilitate both quality and rapid development. Both in the short term of working on each individual sprint/feature, but also on the larger scale being able to have constant streams of communication seem to be at the core of many Agile principles.
